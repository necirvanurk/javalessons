constuctor:
what are costructor:
    constructor is a block of code  that IS  used to construct objects.
why we should use Consturtor
    constructor help us initialize in cleaner and more readable way.
    They are better than methods because they are called automatically when we create an object.
    Most of time field are private and because of this reason we can't access them outside of  the class  in which they are declared and can't initlizat  them
how to use Constructor:
   we create the constructor by writing a block of code that has same name as class name.
   when we create the object of that class it is called automatically.
   Rules:
   1) Constructor don't have return types not even void.
   2) Constructor should have same name as class name.
   3)Constructor can have access modifiers like private public and protected.
   4) Constructor can't have non access modifiers like private public and protected
   5) Default constructor is provided by java if we don't write one.
   6) When we create the object of a class then Constructor is called.    forex: Dog dog1 =new Dog();
   7) We can create multiple Constructor to give the other users flexibility that they don't have to provide all the instance fields when creating an object of our class.
   8)we can call the constructor of a class by using this keyword with parenthesis.
this() we can pass parameters and java will decide based on these parameters which constructor to call.
    "this" keyword:
    when ever we can same name variables as instance  variable and local variables this keyword can help us resolve the conflict between local and instance variable
   class Human{

   String name ="sleeping zombi ";

   void printName(){
   String name="wake up zombi"

   System.out.println(name);
   }
   }
   =====================================================================
What is inheritance:
   inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can get the properties and methods from the parent class inside the child class.
why we should use inheritance:
   inheritance helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write forex :if there are some properties and
    can put the common properties or method inside that parent class and can make children classes extend
how we can inheritance:
   1)create a parent class
   2) put all the common methods and properties from children classes inside that parent class.
   3)use extend keyword to inherit from that parent class.
Rules:
   1)private fields and private methods can't be inherited inside the children classes.
    Constructors are also not inherited.
